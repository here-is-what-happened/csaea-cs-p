# Challenge 1: Circle Area with Math Library
# Use two variables "radius" and "circle_area" to calculate the area of a circle with a diameter of 14. 
# Formulas: the area of a circle is πr² -- the radius is diameter / 2

diameter = 14
radius = diameter/2

area = math.pi * math.pow(radius, 2)
print(f"\nThe radius of the circle is {radius}. \nThe area of the circle is {area}")

# Random number generator

# Create your own pseudorandom number generator that utilizes as seed to output a random number. 
# The seed should be a floating-point number with five total digits (including those before and after the decimal), and it must be greater than 100.0. 
# Perform at least 3 different math calculations on it (ie, addition, subtraction, and division). 
# Use math library to round the float UP to an integer. 
# BONUS CHALLENGE: Make your random number output between 1 and 10. 

seed = 6

seed = seed/6.7
seed = seed - 800

#  seed = random.randint(0, 10000)
#  seed = math.ceil(seed)
